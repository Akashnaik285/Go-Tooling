# Go-Tooling


# Chapter 11: Go Tooling

Go is a powerful programming language, but its utility is greatly enhanced by the tools that accompany it. These tools help developers manage the entire lifecycle of their code, from writing and formatting to testing and distribution. In this chapter, we will explore some of the most important Go tools, including `go run`, `go install`, `goimports`, and various code-quality scanners like `staticcheck` and `revive`.

## Using `go run` to Try Out Small Programs

Go is a compiled language, meaning that before you can run a Go program, it must be compiled into an executable file. However, for quick testing and experimentation, Go provides the `go run` command, which compiles and runs a Go program in one step.

### Example: Hello, World!

Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```go
// hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

To run this program, use the `go run` command:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

### How `go run` Works

When you run `go run hello.go`, Go compiles the code into a binary, executes it from a temporary directory, and then deletes the binary after the program finishes. This makes `go run` ideal for quick testing and scripting-like usage.

## Adding Third-Party Tools with `go install`

Go allows you to install third-party tools directly from their source code repositories using the `go install` command. This is particularly useful for installing developer tools written in Go.

### Example: Installing `hey`

`hey` is a popular tool for load testing HTTP servers. You can install it using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

This command downloads the `hey` tool, compiles it, and installs the binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Running `hey`

Once installed, you can run `hey` to load test a website:

```bash
hey https://go.dev
```

Output:
```
Summary:
  Total:        2.1272 secs
  Slowest:      1.4227 secs
  Fastest:      0.0573 secs
  Average:      0.3467 secs
  Requests/sec: 94.0181
```

### Updating Tools

To update an installed tool, simply rerun `go install` with the `@latest` tag:

```bash
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

## Improving Import Formatting with `goimports`

`goimports` is an enhanced version of `go fmt` that not only formats your code but also manages your import statements. It organizes imports alphabetically, removes unused imports, and attempts to add missing imports.

### Installing `goimports`

You can install `goimports` using `go install`:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

### Running `goimports`

To format your code and manage imports, run:

```bash
goimports -l -w .
```

- `-l`: Lists files that would be modified.
- `-w`: Writes changes to the files.
- `.`: Applies the command to the current directory and all subdirectories.

### Example: Using `goimports`

Consider the following Go file with disorganized imports:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    fmt.Println("Random number:", rand.Intn(100))
}
```

Running `goimports` will organize the imports and format the code:

```bash
goimports -l -w main.go
```

The imports will be sorted alphabetically, and the code will be formatted according to Go standards.

## Using Code-Quality Scanners

Code-quality scanners, or linters, help you identify potential issues in your code that go beyond what the compiler checks. These tools can catch common mistakes, enforce coding standards, and improve the overall quality of your code.

### `staticcheck`

`staticcheck` is a powerful linter that checks for a wide range of issues, including unnecessary code, unused variables, and more.

#### Installing `staticcheck`

```bash
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
```

#### Running `staticcheck`

To scan your code, run:

```bash
staticcheck ./...
```

#### Example: Unnecessary `fmt.Sprintf`

Consider the following code:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    s := fmt.Sprintf("Hello")
    fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Running `staticcheck` will flag the unnecessary use of `fmt.Sprintf`:

```bash
staticcheck ./...
main.go:6:7: unnecessary use of fmt.Sprintf (S1039)
```

### `revive`

`revive` is another linter that focuses on code style and quality. It is based on `golint` but offers more configurability.

#### Installing `revive`

```bash
go install github.com/mgechev/revive@latest
```

#### Running `revive`

To run `revive`, use:

```bash
revive -config built_in.toml ./...
```

#### Example: Shadowing Built-in Identifiers

Consider the following code:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    true := false
    fmt.Println(true)
}
```

Running `revive` with a configuration file that checks for shadowing built-in identifiers will flag the issue:

```bash
revive -config built_in.toml ./...
main.go:6:2: assignment creates a shadow of built-in identifier true
```

## Conclusion

Go's tooling ecosystem is designed to make development easier and more efficient. From running small programs with `go run` to managing dependencies with `go install`, formatting code with `goimports`, and ensuring code quality with linters like `staticcheck` and `revive`, these tools help you write better Go code. By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can improve your productivity and the quality of your software.


# **golangci-lint: A Comprehensive Linting Tool for Go**

`golangci-lint` is a powerful and highly configurable linting tool for Go that integrates over 50 code-quality tools, including `go vet`, `staticcheck`, and `revive`. It is designed to make it easy to configure and run multiple linters in a single command, providing a comprehensive analysis of your codebase. This section will explain `golangci-lint` in depth, including installation, configuration, and usage with examples.

---

## **Why Use `golangci-lint`?**

Linting tools help identify potential issues in your code, such as:
- Unused variables
- Shadowed variables
- Code style violations
- Potential bugs
- Security vulnerabilities

While tools like `go vet`, `staticcheck`, and `revive` are useful individually, `golangci-lint` combines them into a single tool, making it easier to enforce code quality across your project. It also allows you to customize which linters to enable and configure their behavior.

---

## **Installing `golangci-lint`**

While you can install `golangci-lint` using `go install`, it is recommended to download a precompiled binary for better performance and compatibility. Follow the installation instructions from the [official website](https://golangci-lint.run/).

For example, on Linux or macOS, you can install it with:

```bash
# Install golangci-lint
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.54.2
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
golangci-lint --version
```

---

## **Running `golangci-lint`**

To run `golangci-lint` on your project, use the following command:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

This command will analyze your code using the default set of linters and report any issues.

---

## **Example: Detecting Unused Variables**

Consider the following Go code:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10 // Unused variable
    y := 20
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```

Running `golangci-lint` will detect the unused variable `x`:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

Output:
```
main.go:6:2: ineffectual assignment to `x` (ineffassign)
    x := 10
    ^
```

---

## **Example: Shadowing Variables**

`golangci-lint` can also detect shadowed variables, which occur when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope.

Consider this code:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "fmt"

var b = 20 // Global variable

func main() {
    true := false // Shadowing a built-in identifier
    a := 10
    b := 30 // Shadowing the global variable `b`
    if true {
        a := 20 // Shadowing the local variable `a`
        fmt.Println(a)
    }
    fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

Running `golangci-lint` with the appropriate configuration will detect the shadowing issues:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

Output:
```
main.go:5:5: var `b` is unused (unused)
    var b = 20
    ^
main.go:10:2: declaration of "b" shadows declaration at line 5 (govet)
    b := 30
    ^
main.go:12:3: declaration of "a" shadows declaration at line 9 (govet)
    a := 20
    ^
main.go:8:2: variable `true` has same name as predeclared identifier (predeclared)
    true := false
    ^
```

---

## **Configuring `golangci-lint`**

`golangci-lint` is highly configurable. You can specify which linters to enable, disable, or customize by creating a `.golangci.yml` file in the root of your project.

### Example Configuration File

Hereâ€™s an example `.golangci.yml` file that enables `govet` and `predeclared` linters and configures them to detect shadowing:

```yaml
linters:
  enable:
    - govet
    - predeclared

linters-settings:
  govet:
    check-shadowing: true

settings:
  shadow:
    strict: true
    enable-all: true
```

### Explanation of the Configuration

1. **`linters.enable`**: Specifies which linters to enable. In this case, `govet` and `predeclared` are enabled.
2. **`linters-settings.govet.check-shadowing`**: Enables shadowing checks in the `govet` linter.
3. **`settings.shadow`**: Configures the shadowing detection to be strict and enables all shadowing checks.

## **Using `govulncheck` to Scan for Vulnerable Dependencies**

`govulncheck` is a tool developed by the Go team to scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It checks both the standard library and third-party libraries for security issues.

### Installing `govulncheck`

Install `govulncheck` using `go install`:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
```

### Running `govulncheck`

To scan your project for vulnerabilities, run:

```bash
govulncheck ./...
```

### Example: Detecting a Vulnerability

Consider a project that uses an outdated version of the `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` library, which has a known vulnerability:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "gopkg.in/yaml.v2"
)

func main() {
    data := `name: "Go"`
    var info struct {
        Name string `yaml:"name"`
    }
    err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &info)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("error: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", info)
}
```

The `go.mod` file specifies the vulnerable version of the library:

```go
module example.com/vulnerable

go 1.20

require gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.7
```

Running `govulncheck` will detect the vulnerability:

```bash
govulncheck ./...
```

Output:
```
Vulnerability #1: GO-2020-0036
Excessive resource consumption in YAML parsing in gopkg.in/yaml.v2
More info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2020-0036
Module: gopkg.in/yaml.v2
Found in: gopkg.in/yaml.v2@v2.2.7
Fixed in: gopkg.in/yaml.v2@v2.2.8
Example traces found:
#1: main.go:14:23: vulnerable.main calls yaml.Unmarshal
```

### Fixing the Vulnerability

Update the dependency to the patched version:

```bash
go get -u=patch gopkg.in/yaml.v2
```

Re-run `govulncheck` to confirm the issue is resolved:

```bash
govulncheck ./...
```

Output:
```
No vulnerabilities found.
```

## **Embedding Content into Your Program**

Go provides a built-in way to embed files and directories directly into your binary using the `//go:embed` directive. This is useful for including static assets like templates, configuration files, or data files.

### Example: Embedding a Text File

Consider a program that checks if a password is in a list of common passwords:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

//go:embed passwords.txt
var passwords string

func main() {
    pwds := strings.Split(passwords, "\n")
    if len(os.Args) > 1 {
        for _, v := range pwds {
            if v == os.Args[1] {
                fmt.Println("true")
                os.Exit(0)
            }
        }
        fmt.Println("false")
    }
}
```

The `passwords.txt` file is embedded into the binary at compile time.

### Example: Embedding a Directory

You can also embed an entire directory using `embed.FS`:

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
    "io/fs"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

//go:embed help
var helpInfo embed.FS

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) == 1 {
        printHelpFiles()
        os.Exit(0)
    }
    data, err := helpInfo.ReadFile("help/" + os.Args[1])
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data))
}

func printHelpFiles() {
    fmt.Println("contents:")
    fs.WalkDir(helpInfo, "help", func(path string, d fs.DirEntry, err error) error {
        if !d.IsDir() {
            _, fileName, _ := strings.Cut(path, "/")
            fmt.Println(fileName)
        }
        return nil
    })
}
```

This program embeds the `help` directory and allows users to view its contents or read specific files.

---

## **Conclusion**

`golangci-lint` is a powerful tool for improving the quality of your Go code. By combining multiple linters into a single tool, it simplifies the process of enforcing coding standards and identifying potential issues. Additionally, tools like `govulncheck` help ensure your dependencies are secure, and the `//go:embed` directive makes it easy to include static assets in your binaries. By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can build more robust and maintainable Go applications.



# **Embedding Hidden Files and Advanced Go Tooling**

In this section, we will explore advanced Go tooling features, including embedding hidden files, using `go generate`, reading build information, cross-compiling Go binaries, and using build tags. These tools and techniques are essential for building robust, maintainable, and portable Go applications.

---

## **Embedding Hidden Files**

Go's `//go:embed` directive allows you to embed files and directories into your Go binary. However, by default, files and directories starting with `.` or `_` (hidden files) are excluded. To include hidden files, you can use special patterns in the `//go:embed` directive.

### Example: Embedding Hidden Files

Consider a directory structure with hidden files:

```
parent_dir/
  .hidden
  visible
  child_dir/
    .hidden
    visible
```

Hereâ€™s how you can embed hidden files in different ways:

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
    "io/fs"
)

//go:embed parent_dir
var noHidden embed.FS

//go:embed parent_dir/*
var parentHiddenOnly embed.FS

//go:embed all:parent_dir
var allHidden embed.FS

func main() {
    checkForHidden("noHidden", noHidden)
    checkForHidden("parentHiddenOnly", parentHiddenOnly)
    checkForHidden("allHidden", allHidden)
}

func checkForHidden(name string, dir embed.FS) {
    fmt.Println(name)
    allFileNames := []string{
        "parent_dir/.hidden",
        "parent_dir/child_dir/.hidden",
    }
    for _, v := range allFileNames {
        _, err := dir.Open(v)
        if err == nil {
            fmt.Println(v, "found")
        }
    }
    fmt.Println()
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`noHidden`**: Embeds only non-hidden files in `parent_dir`. Hidden files are excluded.
2. **`parentHiddenOnly`**: Embeds all files in the root directory, including hidden files, but excludes hidden files in subdirectories.
3. **`allHidden`**: Embeds all files, including hidden files in all subdirectories.

### Output

```
noHidden

parentHiddenOnly
parent_dir/.hidden found

allHidden
parent_dir/.hidden found
parent_dir/child_dir/.hidden found
```

---

## **Using `go generate`**

`go generate` is a tool for automating code generation tasks. It looks for special comments in your source code and runs the commands specified in those comments. This is particularly useful for generating code from schemas (e.g., Protocol Buffers) or adding boilerplate code.

### Example: Generating Code with Protocol Buffers

1. Install the `protoc` compiler and the Go plugin:

   ```bash
   # Install protoc (follow instructions for your OS)
   # Install the Go plugin
   go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28
   ```

2. Create a `person.proto` file:

   ```proto
   syntax = "proto3";

   message Person {
       string name = 1;
       int32 id = 2;
       string email = 3;
   }
   ```

3. Add a `//go:generate` comment to your Go file:

   ```go
   //go:generate protoc -I=. --go_out=. --go_opt=module=github.com/example/proto_generate person.proto
   ```

4. Run `go generate`:

   ```bash
   go generate ./...
   ```

5. Use the generated code:

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "github.com/example/proto_generate/data"
       "google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
   )

   func main() {
       p := &data.Person{
           Name:  "Bob Bobson",
           Id:    20,
           Email: "bob@bobson.com",
       }
       fmt.Println(p)
       protoBytes, _ := proto.Marshal(p)
       fmt.Println(protoBytes)
       var p2 data.Person
       proto.Unmarshal(protoBytes, &p2)
       fmt.Println(&p2)
   }
   ```

---

## **Reading Build Information**

Go binaries include metadata about the build process, such as the Go version, dependencies, and build flags. You can inspect this information using `go version -m`.

### Example: Inspecting Build Information

```bash
go build
go version -m myprogram
```

Output:
```
myprogram: go1.20
path github.com/example/myprogram
mod github.com/example/myprogram (devel)
dep github.com/some/dependency v1.2.3
build -compiler=gc
build GOARCH=amd64
build GOOS=linux
build vcs=git
build vcs.revision=abc123
build vcs.time=2023-10-01T12:34:56Z
```

---

## **Cross-Compiling Go Binaries**

Go makes it easy to build binaries for different operating systems and architectures using the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables.

### Example: Cross-Compiling for Linux on ARM64

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o myprogram_linux_arm64
```

---

## **Using Build Tags**

Build tags allow you to conditionally include or exclude files during compilation based on the target platform, Go version, or custom flags.

### Example: Using Build Tags

1. Create a file `myfile_linux.go`:

   ```go
   //go:build linux

   package main

   import "fmt"

   func init() {
       fmt.Println("This file is for Linux only")
   }
   ```

2. Create a file `myfile_windows.go`:

   ```go
   //go:build windows

   package main

   import "fmt"

   func init() {
       fmt.Println("This file is for Windows only")
   }
   ```

3. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   GOOS=linux go build
   ./myprogram
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   This file is for Linux only
   ```

---

## **Exercises**

1. **Embedding Files**:
   - Download the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in multiple languages.
   - Embed these files into your Go program and print the UDHR in the requested language.

2. **Using `staticcheck`**:
   - Install `staticcheck` and run it on your program to fix any issues.

3. **Cross-Compiling**:
   - Cross-compile your program for ARM64 on Windows or AMD64 on Linux.

---

## **Conclusion**

Go's tooling ecosystem is designed to make development efficient and reliable. By mastering tools like `go generate`, `go version -m`, and `go build` with build tags, you can build high-quality, portable, and maintainable Go applications. These tools empower you to automate repetitive tasks, ensure code quality, and deploy your software across multiple platforms with ease.
